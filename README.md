# Tabrifics Stockist Map
Shopify Liquid Element snippet to display interactive map of Tabrifics stockists

Data is fetched from a Google Sheet containing the stockist data. The Google Sheet is published to the web and the URL is used to fetch the data.

Used [PapaParse and instructions from Tabletop](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop) to fetch data from Google Sheets.

### Setup
Just copy paste the contents of stockists.html into a liquid element.

To keep up to date, just add or remove entries to the linked Google Sheet which contains the stockist information.
